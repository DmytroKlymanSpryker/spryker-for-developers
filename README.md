## Reason X: Basic characteristics of Spryker Development
Let's start off with some development principles that Spryker is based on, an why you might like working with it.
* Spryker`s entire architecture is built upon the best practices and well-known design principles [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it), [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) & [Factory method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern);
* Spryker has multiple levels of code reviews that are integrated into the development process:   
  * Developer code review      
  * Technical lead code review       
  * Application architect code review
* Besides the above human reviews, Spryker uses various tools for monitoring the quality of the codebase and performance of the product in general: [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/), [PHPMD](https://phpmd.org/), [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/), [Codeception](https://codeception.com/);
* We like to say that we are positive perfectionists, and work only with clean and high-quality code. But you don't need to take that from us: Check our incredible  code quality rating on [Scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/spryker/spryker-core/?branch=master) [![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/spryker/spryker-core/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/spryker/spryker-core/?branch=master). * Our code is open and accessible for everyone to see. Our code is **not** released under an open source license, but all code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/spryker), there are no parts hidden or encoded.

## Reason Xa: Programming language: PHP
Nearly 80% of websites use PHP ([source](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php)), PHP has been one of the top 5 programming languages since the year 2000 ([source](https://statisticsanddata.org/data/the-most-popular-programming-languages-1965-2022-new-update/)), and it's the foundation of the most popular framework Laravell ([source](https://statisticsanddata.org/data/most-popular-backend-frameworks-2012-2022/)).

PHPs flexibility and low barrier of entry is both a blessing and a curse. The curse being that, for some developers, PHP has gotten a bad reputation because of its perceived inconsistencies, security matters, sloppy syntax and simply because it is everywhere. If something is very popular, it's almost inevitable that there will be a lot of people messing it up.

But this is not inherent to PHP: if you [follow proper design principles like we do at Spryker](#reason-x-basic-characteristics-of-spryker-development),

Highly proficient PHP developers are sought after, so if you can master it, you have the potential to earn lots of money. That popularity means there are plenty of career opportunities out there. Another good reason to learn PHP: it pairs great with other skills and languages.

### Relative ease to find new developers
Finding good developers is never easy, but because of PHPs popularity, it's easy to find developers with PHP experience that can be trained to use Spryker. We also have good experience onboarding Java developers, because of their experience with Object Oriented Programming which is very similar to what Spryker is doing with PHP.

## Reason X: No need for a big team to build or run a Spryker project
:construction:	[TODO]

## Reason X: Long term maintainability
:construction:	[TODO]

## Reason X: Job security
Some factors that indicate that Spryker is on the rise:

### Customer satisfaction

* G2 4.4 out of 5 stars: https://www.g2.com/products/spryker-cloud-commerce-os/reviews
* Gartner 4.5 out of 5 stars: https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/digital-commerce/vendor/spryker/product/spryker-cloud-commerce-os

### Analyst recognition
Like it or not, large Enterprises look at analyst firms for advice when they're buying new software. A good (and growing) score in analyst reports is therefore a good indication for upcoming Enterprise projects.

Spryker scored highest for overall growth of any vendor in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant, with both customer and revenue growth nearing 100%. Customer growth was paralleled by an increasing number of larger service provider partnerships being cemented.

See [spryker.com/analyst-recognition-commerce](https://spryker.com/analyst-recognition-commerce/) for more details and recognition by other analyst firms like Forrester, IDC, MCFADYEN and Paradigm B2B.

#### Best product for Composable Commerce
Spryker is a modular cloud native platform conforming to broader definitions of microservices, but most closely to Gartner’s packaged business capability (PBC) paradigm.

Spryker was recognized in all four Gartner®️ Critical Capabilities Use Cases for Digital Commerce, and a Visionary in the Gartner®️ Magic Quadrant™️ for Digital Commerce for the second consecutive year.
